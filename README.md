## âœ… Features

- ðŸ“² **WhatsApp Notifications (Twilio Sandbox)**
- ðŸ’¬ **Discord Channel Alerts (Webhook-based)**

---

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

After installing, two new nodes will appear in the ComfyUI node menu under **Notifications**:

### ðŸ“² WhatsApp (Twilio) & ðŸ’¬ Discord Notify

These nodes are designed to **act as a bridge** between your image decoder and the final output step â€” such as `[Save Image]`.

For example:

```
[VAE Decode] â†’ [ðŸ’¬ Discord Notify] â†’ [Save Image]
[VAE Decode] â†’ [ðŸ“² WhatsApp (Twilio)] â†’ [Save Image]
```

---

### ðŸ’¬ Discord Notify
Use this node to send a message to a Discord channel via webhook.

**Inputs:**
- `img`: connect it between `[VAE Decode]` and `[Save Image]`
- `message`: the text message to send
- `webhook_url`: Discord channel webhook URL

---

### ðŸ“² WhatsApp (Twilio)
Use this node to send a WhatsApp message via Twilio's API.

**Inputs:**
- `img`: bridge image output to downstream nodes
- `message`: message text
- `sid`: Twilio Account SID
- `token`: Twilio Auth Token
- `from_number`: `whatsapp:+14155238886` (Twilio Sandbox)
- `to_number`: your WhatsApp number (must join sandbox)

## ðŸ›  Installation

Clone this repo into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder:

```

## ðŸ§ª Notes

This was my first custom node â€” built on the fly as a learning project.  
Apologies if parts seem unpolished. Feedback and improvements are welcome!

# ðŸ”” ComfyUI NotificationBridge

A lightweight **notification bridge system** for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).  
Send alerts when a workflow completes â€” currently supports WhatsApp notifications via Twilio and Discord webhooks.

These nodes act as **bridges** between processing steps and the final output (like `[Save Image]`), making them easy to integrate at the tail end of any image pipeline.

## âœ… Features

- ðŸ“² **WhatsApp Notifications (Twilio Sandbox)**
- ðŸ’¬ **Discord Channel Alerts (Webhook-based)**

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

After installing, two new nodes will appear in the ComfyUI node menu under **Notifications**:

### ðŸ“² WhatsApp (Twilio) & ðŸ’¬ Discord Notify

These nodes are designed to **act as bridges** between your decoder and the output step â€” such as `[Save Image]`.

For example:

```
[VAE Decode] â†’ [ðŸ’¬ Discord Notify] â†’ [Save Image]
[VAE Decode] â†’ [ðŸ“² WhatsApp (Twilio)] â†’ [Save Image]
```

### ðŸ’¬ Discord Notify
Use this node to send a message to a Discord channel via webhook.

**Inputs:**
- `img`: bridge input from upstream (e.g., `[VAE Decode]`)
- `message`: text to send
- `webhook_url`: Discord channel webhook URL

---

### ðŸ“² WhatsApp (Twilio)
Use this node to send a WhatsApp message via Twilioâ€™s API.

**Inputs:**
- `img`: bridge input to maintain image flow
- `message`: message text
- `sid`: Twilio Account SID
- `token`: Twilio Auth Token
- `from_number`: `whatsapp:+14155238886` (Twilio Sandbox)

## ðŸ›  Installation

Clone this repo into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder:
